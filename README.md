### Planning and Design
---
## Scope 

Empty Pantry is a site with featuring contemporary design and UX to provide recipes with a basic ingredient search with MealDB Api. The site is built with four responsive pages: a landing page, recipe search page, about page and contact page. The contact page is supported by EmailJs API with an automatic reply message for users to feel acknowledged after sending their initial message.

## Structure 

I plan to keep the layout of the website to be very simple with a popular hamburger style of navigation bar and footer. Each page will be clean and intuitive for the user using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript where appropriate. 
  
## Skeleton 

The Empty Pantry site was planned out with mockup wireframes using Balsamiq. They are as follows:

### Colors

To keep a clean and natural look to the Empty Pantry Website and to enhance and idea of health, I used warm browns and greens. I was using a beige for the background but it wasn't providing enough of a contrast to benefit the UX. 

For the navbar, footer and background I used a warm off-white called #fafafa which I used in my last project, Stardust Gym, to create a clean effect and provide enough contrast with the text. I like this white because it is softer on the eyes. I do favour using white backgrounds because they look refreshing and are easy to read from. 


* Black: #1F2027
* Brown: #463e2e
* Beige: #F3ECE8
* Green: #535b31
* Off-white: #fafafa

### Images 
   * Images were really important for this project. The landing page is a huge image of a modern and warm kitchen. I used this so the site visitor can feel like they were in the kitchen getting ready to cook. For the recipe page, the images are provided from the mealDB API. The About page has a very lovely green image of cabbage as the background to create an effect of freshness, energy and simplicity. Below is a carousel of clean images of a kitchen shelf and menu items which I ensure have alt text. The Contact page has a light pattern of vegetables in the background I made to add a little interest to the page but to not be too busy against the contact form. 
 
### Fonts
* To stress contemporary design and consistency, and enhance the idea of simplicity, basics, and health, I used Courier New for the navbar, Courier new is such a familiar and old font it helps to create the idea of coming home when using this app. I used  Rozha One for headings as it is a very strong font and Raleway for most of the content on the site, again because it is easy on the eyes, clean and modern. Rozha One and Raleway were from Googlefonts.

### Feedback from Testing Users

* Can only type one ingredient at a time **FIXED**-my solution was to create a prompt to inform user this is a beta site**
* Pictures of recipes are too big **FIXED**- I decreased the size of the images by percentage so they suit responive designs, also made pictures into circles** 
* The content of recipe, about and contact page are hard to read. **FIXED**-Made a better contrast with colors by using black and white.**
* The send button on the email page didn't notify the user their email was sent and they kept sending the email over again. **FIXED**- added a prompt to the send message button and included a message in the text box**
* Include a way to filter recipes for dietary type like vegetarian, low-carb... **PENDING**
* Fix the size of the landing page to avoid having to scroll **FIXED**
* Remove the prompt on the recipe page because it looks messy **FIXED** changed the prompt into if/else statement in innerHTML
* Make the contact page background a better contrast **FIXED** changed image for background.
* Make recipe images smalled for desktop **FIXED** solved this with media query.



### Bugs
---
 * Navbar dropdown not collapsing cleanly for mobile and tablet settings, the links were floating in the content. Redid the navbar with bootstrap and Chrome Dev Tools.
* Landing page was not extending fully on tablets so i changed the image to be a background image for the body in css instead, i had originally included a footer for the landing page which the gap initially helped but the footer wasn't necessary and took away from the effect of creating an environment for the user.
* Tried using Spoonacular API for a while, I struggled with this. I also was trying to use it without using my credit card because it is a freemium API and I didn't feel too confident about that at the point of time, in case anything went wrong. I considered using RecipePuppy API but it was too messy in the way it presents itself. 
 * Recipes from the API were coming out really long and not separated. Tried making modal it was hard to separate each recipe from the search response so I made a toggle bar with help from [mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary). 
 * Email page was not notifying the user they sent the email so they thought it wasn't sent and kept pushing the send button so I recieved many repeat emails. I fixed this with adding a prompt via the send button and text box.
* The images in the carousel were not showing in the pushed version and I realised I labeled their source file wrong, I fixed this from using Chrome developer tools.
* When checking the code, validating CSS, JavaScript and HTML, i had some missing semi-colons and the comments were a little messy.
* I had a few bugs with meal API. I didn't take note of these very well because I was so focused on trying to solve them. 
* Favicon was not showing-had to edit how the file was named in the code. Now the Favicon is visible.
 * Had issues with the enter button on the homepage. Initially I played with margin, and padding to try and center the button, I ended up finding bootstrap to be most effective.
 * The landing page image was too big and I couldn't figure out why it was needing to be scrolled for figurative empty space, I fixed this with removing a 1220px style height of the container
 * Had issues with the innerHTML response in recipe-sub of recipe page in the javascript, I had a misspelling. The issue was that i would search apple and the text would say "here are your recipe results for apple" and then i would search for chicken but the text would remain as apple.
 * Contact page would validate any text for email because I accidentally had input type as text, changed this to email.
 * Input bar and search button are not aligned. Fixed this by making a grid from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6726135/css-exact-same-height-and-alignment-of-button-and-input-text-box/8911271)
* When testing my site for CSS, the validator found issues with bootstrap on all four pages [here](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Femmasarge.github.io%2Femptypantry%2Fcontact.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
* The footer on the recipe page was floating in the middle of the page on tablets. I wanted to keep a sticky footer because the fixed footer was blocking the recipe results. I tried position absolute and changing the height of the container of the whole page but then if there are more recipe results, they are restricted and you couldn't see all of them. What I have managed to do it push the footer by creating margin-bottom 500px on #meal container. This allows the page to look flexible still.

### References for Code
---
* I used a similar layout as my last project, Stardust Gym for the navbar and footer as it looks clean and it is easy to navigate, the contact page is pretty similar too. . 
* For the recipe search, I found a free API called MealDB. I found a youtube video to show an example of how to set the API up:[Video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAUCtt6YI3E).
* I referred to Bootstrap libraries a lot 
* I referred to CodeAcademy to get a better understanding of Javascript. I was having a very hard time with Javascript from the LMS as it was harder to understand. [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)
* I did look at StackoverFlow, I did get some ideas to solutions from it, mostly with Jquery. Most of the time I gained benefits by looking at other people's code to understand how it worked, it was more further learning with a visual aspect. This helps me a lot, to work from literal examples. [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* I did look at the last exercise from Code Institute in regards to the Rosie CV project, this is what I used for the Email.js page. I was trying to figure out how to apply the MEALDB API in a similar way to the GitHub Resume.

* I would like to thank the Code Institute for the knowledge shared.
* I would like to thank my mentor Chris for his support and encouragement.
